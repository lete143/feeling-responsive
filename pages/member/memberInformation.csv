After a large scale disaster happens, it can be very important for people to quickly share some information. To achieve this issue, he specifically considers how to achieve efficient data transfer and data synchronization among isolated data servers formed after disasters. He is now involved with a project called RIM (Resilient Information Management) and trying to construct a disaster resilient network. His research interests are mainly focusing on wireless and mobile networks."m5191109,Keisuke Tamoi,,,,,d8162103,Khanh Dang Nam,,,,,d8161104,Michael Conrad Meyer,,,,,m5182108,Pham Van Thanh,,,,,d8171105,Phuc Viet Trinh,VIETNAMESE,"Vietnamese (native), English","d8171105@u-aizu.ac.jp,vietphuc17@gmail.com",https://sites.google.com/site/vietphuctrinh/,"Phuc V.
